<h3>Hi there 👋 I'm Olga😉</h3>
<p>
I'm learning Python and growing as a developer.  
I like to understand how things work under the hood, not just make them run.

Building projects, breaking things, fixing them — and learning along the way.  
Turning curiosity into projects and mistakes into experience.  
Focused on practical skills, clean setups, continuous learning,  
and automating what can be automated.
